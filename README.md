# SRE Protege Plugin
This work proposes a prototypical implementation of an debugging algorithm for SWRL rules that we call Single Rule Evaluation (SRE).
For practical application, the code is Java-based and can be used in the Ontology Editor Protégé.

A documentation for the plugin will be available soon. Moreover in near future a Standalone version of the Plugin will be available, too.
